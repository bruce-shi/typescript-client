# This proxy configuration is one that allows the use of a gRPC proxy between Weaviate and the client.
# It is used in the CI/CD pipeline to test the gRPC proxy functionality of the client.
# It follows the method as described here: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/http/upgrades#connect-support
# where special attention should be paid to the fact that we are using a terminating HTTP/2 connection,
# as in this example: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/8e93d16d433d3364c2b000dc9067ffc400e8f0d6/configs/terminate_http2_connect.yaml,
# because Weaviate itself is not capable of handling CONNECT requests. So Envoy instead upgrades these to POSTs and sends them on
